            <p>With E-Summit 2021 just around the corner, (2nd-4th April 2021), we are proud to present, Internship Fair 1.0, the first of its kind in E-Summit. It's no secret that engineering students have the most diverse set of qualities and strengths, and it's our firm belief that with your guidance and support, their unrelenting passion and hard work, a profitable symbiosis is attainable. We believe that your brand's unique set of skills and experience in your respective fields and start-ups would be benefitted by having young, bright and innovative minds. Through the internship fair, we hope to bring you all a step closer to a hotspot of the brightest minds in the state, maybe even in the country. We are open to paid & unpaid internship offers for the students. We are also hoping for a live session with you all, so the students can hear from the experts and founders themselves, about the companies that are offering internships. This would also allow you to judge the students according to your requirements. </p>
